# This is a placeholder for the Gradle wrapper JAR file
# The actual gradle-wrapper.jar is a binary file that needs to be downloaded
# 
# To get the proper gradle-wrapper.jar file:
# 1. Run: gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.4
# 2. Or download from: https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.4-bin.zip
# 3. Extract and copy gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar to this location
#
# For now, you can use the simplified build approach with Android Studio or
# install Gradle directly and use: gradle assembleDebug
